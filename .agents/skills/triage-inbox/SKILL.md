# /triage-inbox [scan]

> Alignment check: Before choosing an approach, verify it aligns with `docs/ideal.md` and relevant decision records in `docs/decisions/`. If this work touches a known compromise in `docs/spec.md`, respect its limitation type and evolution path. If none apply, say so explicitly.

Canonical inbox triage leaf skill. Direct invocation is allowed, and
`/triage inbox` routes here.

## Modes

- **Processing mode** (`/triage-inbox` or `/triage inbox`)
  - interactive and action-taking
  - may create stories, ADRs, spec notes, or other artifacts
  - may delete processed items from `docs/inbox.md`
- **Scan mode** (`/triage-inbox scan` or `/triage inbox scan`)
  - read-only
  - used by the `/triage` orchestrator
  - standalone scan may recommend within the inbox lane; full-sweep `/triage`
    scan returns a neutral lane packet and does not edit files

## Lane Packet Mode

When full-sweep `/triage` asks for scan mode or a lane packet, return up to
three neutral inbox candidates or stop conditions. Do not choose the repo-wide
winner and do not process items. For each candidate include candidate name,
lane type, Ideal/spec value, coverage/eval evidence where relevant, source
inbox evidence, why now, action shape, story-worthiness, validation/stop
condition, blockers, and reasons not now.

In lane-packet mode, treat `### Top Candidates` as non-final scan evidence. Do
not populate `### Recommended Action` with an inbox item to process; use that
field only to hand the packet back to main `/triage` or to say there is no
inbox-lane action. Put actionable options under `### Lane Packet` as neutral
candidates or stop conditions.

Direct standalone invocation may still choose the best inbox-lane item to
process next.

## Steps

1. **Read inbox** — Load `docs/inbox.md`. Present all untriaged items as a
   numbered list with one-line summaries.

2. **Read the shared planning frame for scan/lane evidence**
   Load `docs/ideal.md`, `docs/spec.md`, `docs/methodology/state.yaml`,
   `docs/methodology/graph.json`, and
   `tests/fixtures/formats/_coverage-matrix.json` before judging lane value.
   Use generated `docs/stories.md` only as an index into authored story files;
   do not treat it as writable planning truth.

3. **Staleness sweep** — Before prioritizing, actively search for each item
   across the project to determine if it's already been handled. Inbox items
   often sit for weeks/months and get resolved through ADRs, spec updates, or
   stories without anyone cleaning them up.

   For every item, search:
   - `docs/decisions/` — is there an ADR that already addresses this?
   - `docs/spec.md` — is this already captured in the spec?
   - `docs/stories/` — is there already a story covering this?
   - `docs/methodology/graph.json` and `docs/methodology/state.yaml` — is this already mapped to a category or campaign?
   - recent git log — was this implemented recently?

   Classify each item:
   - **STALE** — already fully handled elsewhere
   - **PARTIALLY HANDLED** — some aspects addressed, but not all
   - **LIVE** — not yet addressed anywhere

4. **Prioritize live items**
   - Read generated `docs/stories.md` only as an index, authored story files
     under `docs/stories/`, and recent git log to understand what's in flight
   - Group items by theme if natural clusters exist
   - Recommend a top 3-5 to process first
   - Flag obvious defer/discard candidates

5. **If scan mode, stop and report**

   Use this format:

   ```markdown
   ## Triage Inbox

   ### Live Items
   - {item}

   ### Stale / Already Handled
   - {item -> where it landed}

   ### Top Candidates
   - {item + short why}

   ### Recommended Action
   - {standalone scan: one next inbox action; lane-packet mode: return packet to main `/triage` or no inbox-lane action}

   ### Lane Packet
   - {neutral inbox candidate + lane type + Ideal/spec/coverage value + evidence + why now + action shape + story-worthiness + validation/stop condition + blockers + reasons not now}

   ### Health Flags
   - {inbox growing / stale backlog / unresolved urgent item}
   ```

   In scan mode, never create artifacts and never edit `docs/inbox.md`.

6. **If processing mode, work items one at a time**
   After the user confirms the order, discuss each item:
   - does this move toward the Ideal or away from it?
   - if it serves a compromise, does the detection eval still fail?
   - if it touches an input, artifact, or channel, read
     `tests/fixtures/formats/_coverage-matrix.json` and identify the real stage gap
   - is this a signal that a compromise can be deleted?
   - what if we do not create a dedicated story?
   - is there already a natural home in an existing draft or pending story?

   Possible outcomes:
   - Fold into existing story
   - New story
   - Research spike
   - ADR
   - Spec update
   - Ideal update
   - Note on existing story
   - Scout expedition
   - Backlog/defer
   - Discard

7. **Create artifacts immediately in processing mode**
   For each decision, create the appropriate artifact before moving on.

8. **Delete processed inbox items in processing mode**
   Once an item lands in a story, spec, ADR, or is explicitly discarded, remove
   it from the inbox instead of archiving it there.

9. **Summarize**
   Quick summary of what was processed, what was deferred, and any follow-up
   actions.

## Handling Links and Resources

Inbox items are often just a URL pasted in a hurry.

When triaging a link-only or link-heavy item:

1. **Quick read** — fetch the content and understand what it is
2. **Summarize and assess**
   - what it is
   - why it matters here
   - value: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
3. **Recommend an action**
   - scout expedition
   - story/spike
   - spec update
   - note on existing story
   - defer
   - discard
4. **Wait for user** — do not auto-scout

## Guardrails

- Processing mode may modify files; scan mode may not
- Always discuss with the user before creating artifacts in processing mode
- Keep the inbox clean — every processed item should land somewhere or be discarded
- For link items: quick-read and recommend, do not auto-launch a full scout
- When used by `/triage`, prefer `scan` mode unless the user explicitly asked to process the inbox now
