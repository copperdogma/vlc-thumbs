# /codebase-improvement-scout [scope] [--create-story] [--autofix] [--autonomous]

> Decision check: If this task affects architecture, workflow, schemas, or cross-cutting agent behavior, read relevant ADRs in `docs/decisions/` plus supporting docs in `docs/runbooks/`, `docs/scout/`, and `docs/notes/` before choosing an approach. If none apply, say so explicitly.

Run a scheduled or on-demand repo-hygiene scan for codebase drift, AI-generated junk, and high-value cleanup opportunities.

Companion runbook: `docs/runbooks/codebase-improvement-scout.md`

## Default Behavior

- **Default mode** — report-only. Create a scan artifact, rank the best improvements, and recommend the next step.
- **`--create-story`** — create exactly one best-fit story for the highest-value non-mechanical improvement if no equivalent story already exists.
- **`--autofix`** — allow only narrow, behavior-preserving cleanup work on a side branch.
- **`--autonomous`** — if the user says "you choose and continue", continue through the next approved step without asking again.

This skill is a repo-hygiene scout, not a free-form refactoring bot. Prefer report plus story over speculative edits.

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap

1. **Create scan artifacts:**

```bash
.agents/skills/codebase-improvement-scout/scripts/start-scan.sh
```

This creates:
- `docs/reports/codebase-improvement/<timestamp>.md`
- `docs/reports/codebase-improvement/_state.yaml` if missing

2. **Record current state:**
   - `git status --short`
   - `git branch --show-current`
   - `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
   - If the worktree is dirty and the user did not explicitly authorize edits on top of it, stay in report-only mode.

3. **Read repo context:**
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `docs/ideal.md`
   - `docs/spec.md`
   - relevant ADRs for likely hotspots
   - relevant runbooks, scout docs, and notes for likely hotspots
   - generated `docs/stories.md`
   - `docs/reports/codebase-improvement/_state.yaml` if it exists

## Phase 1 — Deterministic Discovery

Run the strongest available deterministic checks first. Verify tools exist before using them.

1. **Repo hygiene baseline:**
   - `make check-size` if available; otherwise `wc -l` on likely hotspots
   - `git log --since='30 days' --name-only --format='' | sed '/^$/d' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -50`
   - `rg -n "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK|TEMP|placeholder|stub" modules tests docs scripts benchmarks .agents AGENTS.md`

2. **Project-native quality checks:**
   - `make lint`
   - `make test`
   - `make skills-check`

3. **Optional narrow detectors if installed:**
   - duplication: `jscpd`
   - Python dead code: `vulture`
   - dependency drift: `deptry`

4. **Optional algorithmic complexity detector:**
   - Treat complexity signals as leads, not proof.
   - Look for nested scans, membership/search inside loops, sort-in-loop
     behavior, N+1-shaped IO/query/API loops, and repeated expensive
     derivations in parser or extraction code.
   - For each plausible lead, inspect the local code before ranking it and
     capture current pattern, estimated current complexity, recommended change,
     estimated complexity after, risk level, and tests, benchmarks, driver
     output, artifact inspection, or manual measurements needed.
   - Do not let scanner output outrank generated artifact truth.
   - Do not require remote npm helpers or standalone optimizer skills for this
     scan.

5. **Optional semantic review detector:**
   - Use external repo-wide AI reviewers such as Clawpatch only as occasional
     report-only detectors, not validation, CI, or every-scan requirements.
   - Natural usage is the pilot: run when codebase-improvement freshness is
     stale, churn is high, tests are thin around important code, or a cleanup
     pass needs another latent-bug signal.
   - Run in an isolated worktree, pin the package version or source commit, keep
     generated state outside the repo when possible, start with a small review
     limit, and record the exact command/source in the report.
   - If the pinned tool does not support the current boardgame-ingester surface,
     record it as unavailable instead of forcing adoption.
   - Do not run tool-managed fix commands such as `clawpatch fix` during
     scout-mode use.
   - Treat output as leads until local code reads, repo-native tests, driver
     output, or artifact inspection verify the issue.

6. **Targeted reads:**
   - inspect the top hotspot files
   - inspect recent stories affecting those areas
   - check whether an apparent issue is already tracked or intentionally accepted

## Phase 2 — Triage and Classification

For each candidate finding, classify it as exactly one of:

- **Auto-fix**
  - mechanical
  - behavior-preserving
  - small blast radius
  - no architecture change
  - verifiable by existing checks
- **Story**
  - structural or architectural
  - likely to touch multiple files or layers
  - needs judgment, test design, or artifact inspection
  - better handled by the normal story workflow
- **Suppress**
  - intentional local convention
  - already reviewed and accepted
  - active work makes the signal misleading right now
- **Ignore**
  - cosmetic only
  - too low-value
  - low confidence

Rank findings by leverage, not raw issue count:
- hotspot score
- user-facing or pipeline impact
- maintenance drag
- confidence

Prefer the top 3-5 findings. Low-signal laundry lists are a failure.

For algorithmic complexity candidates, classification is incomplete until the
scan can answer:
- local data shape and hot path
- estimated current complexity
- recommended change and estimated complexity after
- why behavior should remain equivalent
- tests, benchmarks, driver output, artifact inspection, or manual measurements
  needed

For semantic review candidates, classification is incomplete until the scan can
answer:
- exact tool version/source and command
- local evidence confirming the finding
- affected feature, hot path, and severity
- repo-native test, driver-output, or artifact proof needed
- whether to suppress, create a story, or rerun later

## Phase 3 — Write the Scan Report

Fill the generated report with:
- run metadata and scope
- detectors used or unavailable
- complexity findings with current pattern, estimated current complexity,
  recommended change, estimated complexity after, risk level, and proof needed
- semantic-review findings with tool version/source, command, accepted/rejected
  disposition, local evidence, and proof needed
- top findings with classification
- one recommended next step
- story candidate or existing-story link
- suppressions or ignores with rationale

Also update `docs/reports/codebase-improvement/_state.yaml`:
- add newly suppressed findings
- record the run timestamp and top findings
- avoid re-raising recent suppressed items unless the evidence changed

## Phase 4 — Optional Story Creation

If `--create-story` is set or the user explicitly approves:

1. Search generated `docs/stories.md` and existing story files for overlap.
2. If an equivalent story already exists, link it in the report instead of creating a duplicate.
3. Otherwise create exactly one story for the highest-value non-mechanical improvement.
4. Default to `Draft` if the scope is still fuzzy; use `Pending` only when acceptance criteria and tasks are concrete.
5. Link the report in the story notes.

If the user also explicitly approves execution, continue using the normal chain:
- `/build-story`
- `/validate`
- `/mark-story-done`
- `/finish-and-push`

## Phase 5 — Optional Narrow Auto-Fix Lane

Only enter this phase when `--autofix` is set or the user explicitly approved safe cleanup edits.

1. Create a side branch before editing:
   - `git checkout -b codex/codebase-improvement-<timestamp>-<slug>`

2. Restrict changes to narrow safe classes:
   - remove unused imports
   - remove unused dependencies
   - delete provably dead files
   - collapse exact duplicate pure helpers with obvious replacements

3. Hard limits:
   - no more than 5 changed files per cleanup cluster
   - no new abstractions
   - no schema or API changes
   - no structural refactors
   - no pipeline behavior changes requiring new artifact semantics

4. Verification:
   - run the relevant native checks
   - if checks fail twice, revert that cleanup and downgrade it to a story

5. End with a concise summary and recommend `/finish-and-push` unless the user already approved later git steps.

## Guardrails

- Default to report-first, not code-first.
- Never run unconstrained "make the repo better" edits.
- Never re-litigate settled architecture if ADRs or other decision docs already answer the question.
- Never raise the same suppressed finding repeatedly without new evidence.
- Never do cosmetic-only churn.
- Never auto-fix structural or architectural issues.
- Never auto-edit on a dirty worktree unless the user explicitly approved that risk.
- Never commit or push without explicit user permission.
