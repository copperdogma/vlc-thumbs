> Alignment check: Before choosing an approach, verify it aligns with `docs/ideal.md` and relevant decision records in `docs/decisions/`. If this work touches a known compromise in `docs/spec.md`, respect its limitation type and evolution path. If none apply, say so explicitly.

Use this skill whenever the user asks to create a new skill.

## Required Output

Create only:
- `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Optional colocated resources:
- `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/`
- `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/templates/`
- `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/references/`
- `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/assets/`

## Rules

1. Use frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `user-invocable: true` (or `false` for scaffolds not yet ready).
2. Include the alignment check blockquote after the skill header in every new skill:
   ```
   > Alignment check: Before choosing an approach, verify it aligns with `docs/ideal.md`
   > and relevant decision records in `docs/decisions/`. If this work touches a known
   > compromise in `docs/spec.md`, respect its limitation type and evolution path.
   > If none apply, say so explicitly.
   ```
3. Keep instructions implementation-oriented and testable.
4. Avoid tool-specific primary sources (`.cursor/commands`, `.claude/commands`, `.gemini/commands`) for skill content.
5. After creating or changing skills, run: `scripts/sync-agent-skills.sh`
6. Validate with: `scripts/sync-agent-skills.sh --check`
7. Generate provider-specific command aliases only when this repo explicitly keeps slash-command aliases: `scripts/sync-agent-skills.sh --sync-aliases`; validate them with `scripts/sync-agent-skills.sh --check-aliases`.

## Validation Checklist

- New skill exists at canonical path.
- `.claude/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, and `skills` still point to `.agents/skills`.
- No matching Gemini wrapper is required for standard skill discovery.
- Optional command aliases are generated and checked only when intentionally retained.

## Guardrails

- Do not duplicate the same instruction text across tool-specific files.
- Do not commit/push unless user explicitly requests.
