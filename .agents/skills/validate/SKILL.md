# Validate Work Against Requirements

Thoroughly analyze what was done and how it compares to the original instructions using git diff and file analysis.

## Analysis Process

1. **Review Changes**
  Please review ALL local changes, including untracked files.
  Use these commands and include them in your analysis:

  git status --short
  git diff --stat
  git diff
  git ls-files --others --exclude-standard

  For any untracked files, open them and include them in the review. Treat untracked files as part of the change set.

2. **Examine Modified Files**
   - Open each changed file to understand what was implemented
   - Compare against original requirements/story/documentation
   - Check for completeness, quality, and adherence to specifications
   - Treat every positive status claim as provisional until it is backed by
     evidence applicable to the current candidate under `/finish-and-push`'s
     proportional-validation policy

2.25 **Run a findings-first review pass**
   - Review the current diff for concrete bugs, behavioral regressions, missing
     tests, security/trust-boundary risks, and operational hazards before
     grading requirements or closure.
   - Report material findings first, ordered by severity and grounded in
     file/line references when possible.
   - If no material findings are found, say so explicitly and name any residual
     verification limits.
   - Do not let green checks or tidy story bookkeeping hide a real defect.

2.35 **Use `codex review` as an extra signal for non-trivial code diffs**
   - Run it when the user asks for a second-model/code review, the diff is broad
     or high-risk, behavior/security/API/tooling code changed, test coverage is
     uncertain, or the work is nearing commit/ship and a review signal is worth
     the token cost.
   - Skip it for docs-only scout/alignment/inbox routing, generated index
     refreshes, tiny obvious patches, and product/taste decisions. If skipped
     for a code diff, name the reason briefly.
   - Choose the target deliberately:
     - dirty local work: `codex review --uncommitted`
     - branch or PR work: `git fetch origin`, then `codex review --base`
       against the PR base or `origin/main`
     - single committed change: `codex review --commit HEAD`
   - Do not use a clean `--uncommitted` review on a clean checkout as evidence
     that committed branch work is clean; it only proves there is no local
     patch.
   - Treat review output as advisory. Verify each finding against the real code
     path and relevant docs/types before accepting it, reject speculative or
     over-broad findings, and prefer small fixes at the right ownership
     boundary.
   - Keep a terse accepted/rejected finding ledger. If an accepted finding
     changes code, rerun the focused affected tests/checks and rerun the review
     signal for the changed scope.
   - Do not replace `/validate` with `codex review`; it is one evidence source,
     while `/validate` remains the closure authority.

2.5 **If there is a known story/ticket, validate against it**
   - **When a story is "known"**: the user provided a story path/ID/title, or a single story file is clearly in-scope (e.g., `docs/stories/story-*.md`) for the work being validated.
   - Open the story/ticket doc and extract:
     - `## Success Criteria` / `## Acceptance Criteria` / `## Requirements` (as applicable)
     - `## Tasks` checklist items (look for `- [ ]` / `- [x]`)
     - `## Workflow Gates` when present
   - Separate **implementation completeness** from **close-out bookkeeping**.
   - Missing close-out items owned by `/mark-story-done` or `/finish-and-push` do **not** count against the story by themselves. This includes items such as:
     - story/status/index flips
     - `CHANGELOG.md`
     - `Story marked done via /mark-story-done`
     - commit/push/PR or other landing hygiene
   - If implementation is complete and only those close-out items remain, treat the story as implementation-complete and recommend **`Close now`** rather than calling the story incomplete.
   - In the report, include a **Story Validation** section that:
     - Lists each story requirement/checklist item as **Met / Partial / Unmet** with evidence.
     - Reports the current workflow-gate state when the story has gates
       (`Build complete`, `Validation complete or explicitly skipped by user`,
       `Story marked done via /mark-story-done`).
     - Explicitly calls out **all Unmet** (and Partial) implementation items as "Remaining Story Gaps" with concrete next steps.
     - Separately notes close-out bookkeeping that belongs to `/mark-story-done` or `/finish-and-push` without scoring it as an implementation failure.
     - Suggests which story checkboxes appear ready to check off, and asks the user if they want the AI to apply those edits.
     - If the delivered slice is coherent but the remaining gaps have clearly been split into other stories, explicitly say whether the current story should be:
       - **Rescoped then closed**
       - **Kept open**
       - **Marked blocked**
       - Same subsystem + same validation boundary + same success surface
         should normally stay **`Keep open`** even if follow-up story shells
         already exist
     - Do not end in an ambiguous "not done" state without a firm recommendation.

2.75 **Read decision context when relevant**
   - If a known story/ticket affects architecture, workflows, schemas, or cross-cutting project behavior, read `docs/ideal.md`, the story's `Spec Refs`, and any ADRs or decision docs in `Decision Refs`.
   - If the story appears to touch those areas and cites no ADRs, search `docs/decisions/` before assuming none exist.
   - Call out missing ADR / decision alignment explicitly in the report when relevant.

2.9 **Use optional parallel validation only when warranted**
   - When launching parallel validation packets, size each worker model and reasoning level to shard risk. Use cheaper or lower-reasoning workers for lookup, compatibility-link or optional-alias checks, and mechanical scans; keep stronger workers for semantic contracts, security, eval correctness, cross-repo decisions, or high-cost misses. Record any explicit override rationale in the validation report.
   - Parallel packets are useful for non-trivial validation slices such as
     findings-first defect review, changed-file review, story requirement
     review, repo-native check/test execution, schema/artifact/eval review,
     and holistic Ideal/spec/decision fit review.
   - Scope each packet to explicit files, commands, requirements, schemas,
     artifacts, or architecture questions. Require applicable evidence for the
     current candidate, and preserve Board Game Ingester's local story,
     artifact, decision, and close-out bookkeeping gates.
   - Subagents may gather evidence or flag findings, but the main thread keeps
     the final score, closure recommendation, story handoff state, and
     yes-ready next step.
   - Do not make subagents mandatory for routine small validation.
   - If subagents are unavailable, unsafe for the checkout, or explicitly
     disabled by the user, run the same validation checks sequentially and
     state that fallback in the report.
   - Escalate to `/loop-verify` for broad or high-risk diffs, repeated material
     fixes during validation, cross-repo rollout surfaces, or cases where one
     complete clean parallel round matters before closure.

3. **Score Each Requirement**
   - **A**: Fully implemented, high quality, exceeds expectations
   - **B**: Implemented well, minor improvements possible
   - **C**: Implemented but has notable issues or missing elements
   - **D**: Partially implemented or significant problems
   - **F**: Not implemented or completely incorrect

## Final Scorecard

Lead with a findings section before the scorecard:

- concrete bugs, behavioral regressions, missing tests, or
  "no material findings found"
- severity ordering for material findings
- file/line references when possible
- residual verification limits when no material findings are found

### Overall Grade: [A/B/C/D/F]

### Summary
- **Requirements Met**: X of Y requirements fully implemented
- **If a story/ticket was validated**: include a 1–2 line summary of whether the story implementation is **Done / Not Done**, and name any remaining implementation gaps separately from close-out follow-up.
- **If a story/ticket was validated**: include a one-line **Closure Recommendation**:
  - `Close now`
  - `Rescope then close`
  - `Keep open`
  - `Mark blocked`
- **Impact**: Add 1–2 plain-language lines on what improved for the operator or end user, what practical risk got smaller, or what they should notice now.
- **Quality Score**: [High/Medium/Low] code quality
- **Testing Coverage**: [Comprehensive/Partial/Minimal]
- **Documentation**: [Excellent/Good/Adequate/Poor]

### Critical Issues (if any)
1. [Issue 1]: [Description and impact]
2. [Issue 2]: [Description and impact]

**Note:** If a story/ticket was validated, treat **Unmet** (and important **Partial**) story requirements as critical issues unless explicitly deferred. Critical issues should summarize "where we are", why the story is not done, and include the concrete next step(s) required to close each gap.
Do **not** treat close-out bookkeeping owned by `/mark-story-done` or `/finish-and-push` as a critical issue by itself.

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. [Priority 1]: [Specific actionable improvement]
2. [Priority 2]: [Specific actionable improvement]
3. [Priority 3]: [Specific actionable improvement]

### Next Steps
- End with a single numbered plan phrased so the user can approve the
  recommended path with a simple `yes`.
- When a story is not ready to close, the plan must start with the **recommended disposition** of the story:
  1) `Rescope then close`, `Keep open`, or `Mark blocked`
  2) Concrete edits needed to support that recommendation
  3) Remaining implementation work, if any
  4) Run tests/smoke and inspect outputs
  5) Re-validate or close

Finish with one direct yes-ready line:
- Prefer the explicit form: Reply `yes` to proceed with: ... when there is one clear next move.
- If there is no honest next step, say that directly instead of asking a
  generic confirmation question.

Default behavior:
- If implementation is complete and the only remaining work is close-out bookkeeping owned by `/mark-story-done` or `/finish-and-push`, prefer **`Close now`**.
- If the remaining work still belongs to the same subsystem, validation
  boundary, and success surface, prefer **`Keep open`** even if follow-up
  stories were already created.
- If the implemented slice is coherent and the remaining gaps are genuinely
  separate and explicitly moved to follow-up stories, prefer
  **`Rescope then close`**.
- If the story cannot honestly proceed because of a dependency or decision,
  prefer **`Mark blocked`**.
- Never silently weaken requirements. The report must say exactly what would be rescoped and why.

Evidence rule:
- Follow `/finish-and-push`'s proportional-validation policy for close-out:
  documentation and evidence changes get affected claim, provenance, link,
  schema, and generated-record inspection; isolated tooling gets focused tests
  and lint; runtime, dependency, build, shared-path, or executable-artifact
  changes broaden according to affected consumers.
- Reuse results when the tested content, environment, and check configuration
  still apply. Record reused evidence and rerun only checks affected by fixes or
  integration changes. Preserve explicit acceptance, semantic, security, and
  mandatory CI or release gates.



## Reviewed Learning Hook

Before final validation handoff, run or explicitly consider `/learning-review`
only when validation found material issues, repeated closeout friction, a
surprising pass/fail result, a missing guardrail, or an explicit user correction
that appears reusable. Skip it for ordinary clean validation. If it returns
`RESULT: candidate-warranted`, report the finding or draft it through
`/learning-candidate`; do not promote or mutate live workflow surfaces during
ordinary validation closeout.
